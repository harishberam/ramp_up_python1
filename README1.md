####  RANDOM MODULE TASK  ####

This Python code is used to generate random employee details for a given number of employees. Let's break down the code step by step:

Importing the random module

Defining the generate_employee_details function: This function takes a single argument, number_employees, which specifies the number of employee details to generate. Inside the function:

A list called cities is defined, containing various city names.
A for loop is used to iterate from 1 to number_employees (inclusive). For each iteration:
An employee ID (Emp_id) is generated as a random integer between 1 and 9999.
An employee salary (Emp_salary) is generated as a random integer between 20000 and 150000.
A city is randomly selected from the cities list.
The function uses the yield keyword to create a formatted string containing the employee ID, city, and salary. This string is yielded back to the caller as a generator output.
The code asks the user to input the number of employee details they want to generate. The input is stored in the variable num_employees.

The code creates a generator object emp_details by calling the generate_employee_details function with the user-provided num_employees.

Looping through the generator: A for loop is used to iterate num_employees times. In each iteration:

The next() function is called on the emp_details generator object, which retrieves the next employee detail formatted string from the generator.
The retrieved string is stored in the variable emp.
The employee detail string is printed to the console.

#### GEO GRAPHIC SHAPES TASK #####

Importing the math module: The code begins by importing the math module, which provides various mathematical functions and constants like π (pi).

Defining the Shape class: This is the base class for different shapes. It has a single method area defined with a pass statement. This method will be overridden in the derived classes to calculate the area specific to each shape.

Defining the Square class: This class is derived from the Shape class. It has an overridden area method that takes a single argument, side_length, and calculates the area of a square using the formula side_length ** 2.

Defining the Triangle class: Similar to Square, this class is also derived from Shape. It has an overridden area method that takes two arguments, base and height, and calculates the area of a triangle using the formula 0.5 * base * height.

Defining the Circle class: Again, this class is derived from Shape. It has an overridden area method that takes a single argument, radius, and calculates the area of a circle using the formula π * radius ** 2.

Creating instances of the shape classes: Three instances are created: sq of type Square, Tr of type Triangle, and Cr of type Circle.

Calculating and printing areas:

The sq instance (square) calculates and prints its area by calling sq.area(5), where 5 is the side length.
The Tr instance (triangle) calculates and prints its area by calling Tr.area(2, 4), where 2 is the base length and 4 is the height.
The Cr instance (circle) calculates and prints its area by calling Cr.area(5), where 5 is the radius.

#### PRODUCERS-CONSUMER TASK ####

Importing Required Modules:

sleep from the time module is used to introduce pauses to simulate work.
Thread from the threading module is used to create threads.
Queue from the queue module provides a way for threads to communicate safely.
User Input:

The code asks the user for two numbers, n1 and n2. These numbers determine how many times the producer and consumer tasks run respectively.
Producer Task:

The producer function simulates a producer creating items.
It creates items by looping n1 times.
For each iteration, it calculates a value as the square of the current number.
It pretends to work by waiting for one second using sleep(1).
It creates a tuple (i, value) to represent the item.
This item is put into a shared queue to be consumed by the consumer.
It prints out what item it added to the queue.
It adds a special item None to signal that no more items will be produced.
Consumer Task:

The consumer function simulates a consumer processing items.
It runs for n2 iterations.
In each iteration, it gets an item from the shared queue.
If the item is None, it stops as it's a signal that no more items will be produced.
It pretends to process the item by waiting for one second using sleep(1).
It prints out the item it "got".
Creating Threads:

A shared queue is created to allow the producer and consumer to communicate.
Starting Threads:

The consumer and producer threads are created using the Thread class, with each targeting its respective function (consumer or producer).
The args parameter is used to pass the shared queue to these functions.
Joining Threads:

The join() method is used to make sure the main program waits for both the producer and consumer threads to finish before proceeding.
