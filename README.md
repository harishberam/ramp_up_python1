### TASK NO 2
### Eamil _id Validation

## Importing the re Module:
The code starts by importing the re module, which provides support for regular expressions in Python.

### Defining the Regular Expression Pattern:
The pattern variable holds a regular expression pattern that is used to validate email addresses. This pattern is intended to match valid email addresses.

### Getting User Input:
The code prompts the user to input an email address and stores it in the mail variable. It also asks the user whether they want to continue ("Yes") or not ("No") and stores their choice in the user_choice variable.

### Validating and Writing Email:
If the user's choice is "Yes" (or variations of "yes"), the code uses re.search() to check if the entered email matches the regular expression pattern. If it's a valid email, the out variable stores the matched portion. The code then opens the "emaildata.txt" file in append mode ('a'), writes the valid email followed by a newline, and closes the file.

### Displaying Emails:
If the user's choice is not "Yes," the code assumes the user wants to exit the email entry loop. It then opens the "emaildata.txt" file in read mode ('r'), reads its contents using fr.read(), and prints the contents to the console.


#### Task No 3

### IP address Validation
Importing Required Modules:
At the start, the code imports two important tools. re is used to work with patterns in text (like IP addresses), and ping3 helps to check if a computer at an IP address can be reached.

### Validating IP Address Format:
The validate_ip function is like a rule checker for IP addresses. It uses a pattern (a set of rules) to see if an input looks like a valid IP address. It checks if the format matches digits separated by periods, like "192.168.0.111". If it matches, it further checks if each number is not larger than 255 (which is the maximum for an IP part). If everything's okay, it returns the full IP address; otherwise, it returns None.

### Writing to File:
The write_to_file function helps with writing messages about IP addresses to a file. If an IP address is considered valid, it writes that it's a valid address. If not, it writes that it's not valid.

## Checking IP Reachability:
The process_ip function checks if an IP address is "alive" by sending a small packet to it and seeing if it responds within a certain time. If it does respond, it's considered reachable, and it's written as valid; otherwise, it's written as non-valid.

### Main Loop for User Interaction:
The program starts a loop that keeps going until the user doesn't want to enter more IP addresses. It asks the user if they want to enter an IP address. If they say "Yes," it asks for the IP, checks if it's correctly formatted using validate_ip, and if it's valid, it checks if it's reachable using process_ip. If it's reachable, it writes that to a file.

### Displaying Results:
After the loop ends (when the user says "No"), the code opens the file that contains the messages about valid and non-valid IP addresses, and it shows these messages on the screen.
